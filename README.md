# Website for Jamie's Bowls

<p>This is the final project for INFO/CS 2300 Intermediate Web Design in 2015sp. We formed a group of 4 to develop this e-commerce website for our client Jamie Jett, a cheer-leading product retailer in Ithaca area. Through the site, potential customers will be able to view and select products, make payments using Paypal, and contact the seller through a contact form if necessary, whereas the site owner can update price and descriptions and add/remove products after login with an administrator account.<\p>

For detailed information about visual, functionality, and database design, user-testing protocal, and other crucial choices we made, check out the Design Journey Map.

For some reason this website is not live yet, we will possibly set it up some time in the future.
